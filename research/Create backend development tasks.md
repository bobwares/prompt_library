i am developing a backend nestjs app.  list the tasks that need to be performed.

The app has been initialized in this repo: https://github.com/bobwares/full-stack-app-nextjs-nestjs-baseline/tree/dev

the backend app resides in the directory project_root/api.

review the project_root/AGENTS.md and project_root/api/AGENTS.md for guidance when writing these tasks.  They should be similar in structure to the tasks create for the db in the directory project_root/db/tasks.
